          "description": "Quick Healing Overview: Rhodochrosite is often associated with matters of the heart and is considered a stone of love and compassion. Those who embrace its energy are thought to experience emotional healing, promoting self-love, self-acceptance, and the release of past emotional wounds. Birthstone & Zodiac Uses: Rhodochrosite is not a traditional birthstone. With its pink color, Rhodochrosite is the natural birthstone of people born in mid-Autumn, from 22 October through 20 November. Rhodochrosite is associated with SCORPIO (23 Oct - 21 Nov). Meditation Uses: Rhodochrosite is a marvelous stone for meditation, expanding the consciousness and allowing for deep relaxation, acceptance, and balance. For Chakra Balancing: Rhodochrosite reflects the Light of the heart and love and stimulates the Heart Chakra. Rhodochrosite's task is also to clear and activate the Solar Plexus Chakra, the energy distribution center, and the chakra of relationships. Crystal Color Energy: The Red color rays within Rhodochrosite bring a self-confidence built on fearlessness, a call to action, and excitement. Pink Rhodochrosite brings the subtle, more feminine energy rays of determination, commitment, and caring. Associated Goddesses: Rhodochrosite honors Nisaba, the Summerian Knowledge Goddess and Goddess of the Palace Archives. Feng Shui Uses: Rhodochrosite, with its Pink color, is used in the southwest area of a room or home. It is associated with love, romance, and motherhood. Use it in the southwest area of a room or home to bring the feminine energy of growth and maternal love alive. Uses in Divination: The Divinatory meaning of Rhodochrosite: Open your heart to the possibility of love and friendship and you may find that it was close to you or present all the time. Choose old valued friends rather than exciting new acquaintances. Talisman Energy: Rhodochrosite is a Seeker Builder crystal. Seekers contain a crystal energy structure that aligns the natural energy of the crystal to the natural power of the human mind in finding the way to new horizons and new capabilities.",
